# Sign Detection 

 
A real-time sign language recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and classify hand gestures.

## 🚀 Features
- Recognizes basic hand gestures like **Thumbs Up, Peace Sign, Hello, Fist, and Rock Sign**.
- Uses **OpenCV** for real-time video processing.
- Utilizes **MediaPipe Hands** for landmark detection.
- Displays detected sign on screen.

## 📌 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

Install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── sign_detection.py  # Main script
├── README.md          # Project documentation

```

## 🛠️ Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-recognition.git
cd sign-language-recognition
```
2. Run the script:
```sh
python sign_detection.py
```
3. Show different hand gestures in front of the camera to test recognition.

## ✋ Recognized Signs
| Gesture       | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| 👍 Thumbs Up | Approval |
| ✌️ Peace Sign | Victory or peace |
| 👋 Hello | Greeting |
| ✊ Fist | Closed hand |
| 🤘 Rock Sign | Rock & roll or love |



## 🏗️ Future Enhancements
- Add more gestures and sign language alphabets.
- Improve detection accuracy with machine learning.
- Support multiple hands and different angles.
